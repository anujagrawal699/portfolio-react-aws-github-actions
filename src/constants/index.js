export const HERO_CONTENT = `It's not about wanting more, it's about becoming more. \n So i'm not a hardcore web developer, i like to explore low level langauages like C++ and make something out of it. I currently spend most of my nights with Golang and revolving techonologies such as gRPC and GraphQL. I want to be adaptable like a water is in any container in respect of languages and technologies i use. I love to study computer science fundamentals although i have electronics as my major. This hunger for knowledge will surely make me a "Jack of All Trades". PS: Please igore if i missed typing 'n' in ay part of the page, the 'n' key has some hardware glitches.`;

Although i belong to Electronics and Telecommunications Engineering Department, but love to learn computer science. I'm proeficient in Open Source, Cloud Native Technologies, Golang, Networking, Kubernetes, Docker, Competitive Programming, Machine learning, Advanced C++, Web development, Database management, Data Analytics and many more (Curiosity is the Wick in the Candle of Learning). I program in dreams due to OCD dreaming :)`;
